# KanaPractice

To start practicing, run `main.py`.

To see the full hiragana/katakana dictionary, check the `hiragana.py`/`katakana.py` file. 

# KanaPracticeCurses

This is the same as the previous app, just with a very simple interface built with the Curses module.

# Soon
I'll come up with a nice way to print the full dictionary and build a better interface.

# Mistakes
If you find any mistake involving the kanas, please let me know.
